<p class="lead">I strongly believe in learning through practice, and prioritize connecting theoretical principles to real systems. I empower students to move quickly from mathematical modeling to implementation, validating hypotheses through hands-on lab experiments. I specialize in teaching courses focused on Cybersecurity, with extensive training in Computer Science and Electrical and Computer Engineering disciplines.</p>
