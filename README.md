# Hello there!
I am a Ph. D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). My research in wireless communications is focused on developing fair, robust and secure spectrum sharing techniques for 5G networks as they coexist with competing protocols, such as Wi-Fi, and incumbent services, such as radio astronomy systems. My lightweight solutions facilitate concurrent operation of coexisting wireless systems while limiting unintended interference and mitigating adversarial attacks. My work has been published in multiple peer-reviewed venues including the top-ranked IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security. I aim to develop an interoperable coexistence framework for seamless and secure wireless coexistence with both terrestrial and non-terrestrial communications.
